<P>The Developer Kit for Linux includes the IBM just-in-time (JIT)
compiler (libjitc.so). The JIT compiler dynamically generates machine code for
frequently used bytecode sequences in a Java application
or applet while it is running. </P>
<P>All Developer Kit for Linux tools use the JIT
by default. You can disable the JIT to help isolate a problem with a Java 
application, an applet, or the compiler itself. To disable the JIT, type the following at a 
shell prompt.</P>
<PRE>
    export JAVA_COMPILER=NONE
</PRE>

<P>To enable the JIT, type the following
at a shell prompt:</P>

<PRE>
    export JAVA_COMPILER=jitc
</PRE>


<P>To determine if the JIT is enabled, type the following at a shell prompt:</P>

<A NAME="instfont" HREF=#cfgcont><H3>Installing and registering additional fonts</H2></A>

<P>After installation, if you downloaded additional fonts, you can install and register 
them. If you downloaded the fonts in parts, you must first put them back together into
one file for each font.</P>

<P><B>Note:</B>  Asian characters cannot be displayed, even in the Asian locale, 
if you do not have the Times New Roman
MT30 font installed on your system. Therefore, at a minimum, you must 
download the Times New Roman MT30 font to
display Asian characters.</P>

<P>To put a font file back together, use the <B>cat</B>
command.</P>

<P>For example, if you downloaded the Times New Roman MT30 font
in parts, type the following command to put it back together:

<A NAME="eurosymb" HREF=#eurocont><H2>Euro symbol support</H2></A>

<P>To take advantage of the euro symbol support, the operating
system must support the euro symbol. This might require that you
install standard ISO-8859-15 (Latin-9 or Latin-0). For further
information, see the HOWTO for your distribution of Linux.</P>

<P>The following sections give further information on euro symbol support.</P>

<HR>

<P>The Unicode character for the euro is u'20ac'.</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="collate" HREF=#eurocont><H3>Collation of currency symbols</H3></A>

<P>Collation of currency symbols traditionally follows the English
collation order of the symbol name. Thus <B>cent</B> is followed by
<B>dollar</B>. According to this scheme, the euro symbol sorts
immediately following the dollar and dong currency symbols and before
the French franc.</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="usedkit" HREF=#usecont><H2>Using the Developer Kit</H2></A>

<P>The main Developer Kit for Linux tools are programs that are run from
a shell prompt; they do not have a Graphical User Interface (GUI).</P>

<P>The following sections give information on using the Developer Kit
for Linux.</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="pathcons" HREF=#usecont><H3>PATH considerations</H3></A>

<P>After installing the Developer Kit for Linux software, you can run a
tool by typing its name at a shell prompt with a filename as an argument.</P>

<P>You can specify the path to a tool by typing the path before the name of the
tool each time. For example, if the Developer Kit for Linux software
is installed in /opt/IBMJava2-13/bin, you can compile a file named
myfile.java by typing the following at a shell prompt:</P>
<PRE>
  /opt/IBMJava2-13/bin/javac myfile.java
</PRE>
<P>To avoid typing the full path each time:
<OL>
<LI>Add the following directories to the PATH
environment variable:</P>
<UL>  
<LI>/opt/IBMJava2-13/bin</LI>
<LI>/opt/IBMJava2-13/jre/bin</LI>
</UL></LI>
<P></P>
<LI>Compile the file with the <B>javac</B> tool. For example, compile the file myfile.java
by typing the following at a shell prompt:</P>
<PRE>
  javac myfile.java
</PRE>
</LI>
</OL>
<P>The PATH environment variable enables Linux to find executable files,
such as javac, java, and javadoc, from any current directory.  To
display the current value of your PATH, type the following at a
shell prompt:</P>
<PRE>
  echo $PATH
</PRE>

<P>To change the PATH environment variable:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Edit your shell startup
file (usually .bash_profile, .profile, or .login depending on the
shell) and add to
the PATH environment variable the absolute paths to the 
following directories:

<LI>Log on again or run the updated shell
script to activate the new PATH setting.</LI>
</OL> 

<HR>
<A NAME="claspath" HREF=#usecont><H3>CLASSPATH considerations</H3></A>

<P>The CLASSPATH tells the Runtime Environment for Linux and the
Developer Kit for Linux tools, such as java, javac, and javadoc, where
to find the Java class libraries. If you keep the <B>bin</B> and <B>lib</B>
directories under the same parent directory level, the executable
files can find the classes.</P>

<P>You need to explicitly set the CLASSPATH only if one of the following applies:</P>

<UL>
<LI>You require a different library, such as one you develop.</LI>
<LI>You change the location of the <B>bin</B> and <B>lib</B> directories such that
they no longer have the same common parent directory.</LI>
<LI>You plan to develop or run applications using different runtime
environments on the same system.</LI>
<LI>You are running TurboLinux.</LI>
</UL>

<P>To display the current value of your CLASSPATH, type the following at
a shell prompt:</P>
<PRE>
  echo $CLASSPATH
</PRE>

<P>If you plan to develop and run applications using different runtime
environments, you need to explicitly set the CLASSPATH (and PATH)
appropriately for each application. If you plan to simultaneously run 
multiple applications using
different runtime environments, be
sure each application is run in its own shell.</P>

<P>If you want to run only one version of Java at a time, a shell
script can be used to switch between the different runtime environments.</P>

<A NAME="runappl" HREF=#usecont><H3>Running applets with the Applet Viewer</H3></A>

<P>With the Applet Viewer, you can run one or more applets that are called by
reference in a Web page (HTML file) using the APPLET tag. The Applet
Viewer finds the APPLET tags in the HTML file and runs the applets, in
separate windows, as specified by the tags.</P>

<P>Because the Applet Viewer is for viewing applets, it cannot display an
entire Web page that contains numerous HTML tags. It parses only the

<A NAME="dbugappl" HREF=#usecont><H3>Debugging applets with the Applet Viewer</H3></A>

<P>You can debug applets using the <B>-debug</B> option of Applet Viewer. When
debugging applets, it is best to invoke Applet Viewer from the
directory that contains the HTML file that calls the applet. For example:</P>
<PRE>
     cd demo/TicTacToe
     ../../bin/appletviewer -debug example1.html

<A NAME="imfswtch" HREF=#usecont><H3>Switching the input method in DBCS languages</H3></A>
<P>On double-byte character set (DBCS) systems, if you want to switch the input method, 
you must set an 
environment variable that represents the keycode you use for switching.  Optionally, 
you can set 
another environment variable that represents the modifiers of the keycode.</P>

<P>To specify the keycode to use for switching, set the  
IBMJAVA_INPUTMETHOD_SWITCHKEY environment variable to some keycode definition in 
the java.awt.event.KeyEvent class, for example, VK_F4. </P> 
<P>Optionally, specify modifiers of the keycode. 
To specify modifiers of the keycode, set the 
IBMJAVA_INPUTMETHOD_SWITCHKEY environment variable to some combination of 
the following three mask 
definitions in the java.awt.event.InputEvent class:</P>
<UL>
<LI>ALT_MASK</LI>
<LI>CTRL_MASK</LI>
<LI>SHIFT_MASK</LI>
</UL>
<P> Separate the masks by commas.</P>
<P>For example you might set the IBMJAVA_INPUTMETHOD_SWITCHKEY environment variable 
to ALT_MASK, CTRL_MASK. </P>

<P>During Java initialization, the two environment variables are stored.</P>

<P>To be sure you have set the environment variables correctly, press a key and check 
it with the key combination you specified.  If it matches, a Java pop-up 
menu with selectable input methods is displayed.</P>

<A NAME="shipjapp" HREF=#shipcont><H2>Shipping Java applications</H2></A>

<P>A Java application, unlike a Java applet, cannot rely on a Web browser
for installation and runtime services. When you ship a Java application,
your software package probably consists of the following parts:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Your own class, resource, and data files</LI>
<LI>A runtime environment</LI>
<LI>An installation procedure or program</LI>
</UL>

<P>To run your application, a user needs the Runtime Environment for
Linux.  The Developer Kit for Linux software contains a runtime
environment. However, you cannot assume that your users have the
Developer Kit for Linux software installed.</P>
<P>Your Developer Kit for Linux software license does not allow you to
redistribute the Developer Kit for Linux software files.  The Runtime
Environment for Linux is available for redistribution as a separate
package. You can download the
Runtime Environment for Linux from the Web site where you obtained the 
Developer Kit for Linux.</P>

<HR>
<A NAME="trouble" HREF=#trbcont><H2>Troubleshooting</H2></A>

<P>If you encounter a problem after you install the Developer Kit for Linux, check the following 
list:</P>

<UL>
<! Added for defect 8024 >
<LI>Java application appears 
to hang when you compile or run a Java 
application or applet on Caldera eServer 2.3.  
<P>Terminate the application by typing Ctrl+C.
This problem can be caused by an incompatibility in the glibc 
package used by Caldera eServer 2.3. Generally, to resolve the problem, you must 
update the glibc package that is available from the Caldera Support Website. See 
<A HREF=#caldglib>Updating the glibc on Caldera eServer 2.3</A> for instructions.</P></LI>

<LI><CODE>Unable to load libjava.so library</CODE> message.

<P>If you receive a message indicating that the libjava.so library
could not be loaded because of a symbol not found (such as
__bzero), you might have a down-level version of the GNU C Runtime
Library, glibc, installed. The Developer Kit for Linux thread
implementation requires glibc version 2.1 or greater.</P></LI>

<LI>AppletViewer does not load applets.
<P>If the AppletViewer does not load applets, type the following
at a shell prompt:</P>

<PRE>
    java -verbose sun.applet.AppletViewer
</PRE>
<P>This command lists the classes that are being loaded. From this
output, you can determine which class the Applet Viewer is trying
to load and where it is trying to load it from. Check to make sure
that the class exists and is not damaged in some way.</P></LI>

<LI>Application does not handle EINTR return code correctly
<! Added for defect 8265 >
<P>If you are writing a Java application, particularly a JNI application,
be sure that the application handles the EINTR return code
correctly; otherwise the application will fail.  </P></LI>

</UL>


<HR>
<A NAME="limits" HREF=#lmtcont><H2>Known limitations</H2></A>

<UL>

<LI>The Developer Kit for Linux implements Java threads as native threads
which results in each thread being a separate Linux process.  If the
number of Java threads exceeds the maximum number of processes allowed,
your program might get an error message, a SIGSEGV error, or simply
hang.

<P>The maximum number of threads available is determined by the minimum of:
<P></P>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
<LI>The user processes setting (ulimit -u) in
/etc/security/limits.conf</LI>

<LI>The limit MAX_TASKS_PER_USER defined in
/usr/include/linux/tasks.h  (change requires Linux kernel to be
recompiled)</LI>

<LI>The limit PTHREAD_THREADS_MAX defined in libpthreads.so
(change requires Linux kernel to be recompiled)</LI>
</UL>
<P>However, you might run out of virtual storage prior to reaching the
maximum number of threads.  Additional information on adjusting
these limits might be available at the following Web address:</P>
<UL>
<A HREF="http://www.volano.com/linux.html">http://www.volano.com/linux.html</A>.
</UL>
</LI>
<P></P>
<LI>If a Java application is terminated with a Ctrl-C by the user,
a number of processes might be left orphaned.</LI>
<P></P>
<LI>The Runtime for Linux tries to determine which window manager
is being used in Linux and place windows on the screen appropriately.
Occasionally, as is the case with the Enlightenment window manager,
this might result in windows being positioned partially off the screen.</LI>
<P></P>
<LI>The javap program, when run on an interface, duplicates the string
"interface" in the result.  For example, running javap on
"java.lang.Runnable" produces:
<PRE>
     public interface interface java.lang.Runnable extends java.lang.Object...
</PRE></LI>
<LI>Displaying dialog boxes created with Swing might result in a noticeable
delay of a few seconds before they are actually displayed.</LI>
<P></P>
<LI>Key Event results involving the ALT key differ when using different
window managers in Linux; they also differ from results in other operating systems.
In the Enlightenment window manager, Alt+A and Shift+Alt+A produce
different modifiers, and Ctrl+Alt+A produces no key event at all.
However, when using the WindowMaker window manager, Ctrl+Alt+A produces
a key event. 

<P>On the Linux X Window System, the keymap is set to: 64 0xffe9 (Alt_L)
0xffe7 (Meta_L), and 113 0xffea (Alt_R) 0xffe8 (Meta_R). You can check
this by typing the following at a shell prompt:</P>
<PRE>
         xmodmap -pk
</PRE>
<P>This is why the Developer Kit for Linux considers that Meta is being
pressed together with Alt. As a workaround, you can remove the Meta_x
mapping by typing the following at a shell prompt:</P>
<PRE>
         xmodmap -e "keysym Alt_L = Alt_L" -e "keysym Alt_R = Alt_R"
</PRE>
<P><B>Note:</B> This workaround might affect other X-Windows applications running
on the same display if it uses the Meta-key that was removed.</P>
