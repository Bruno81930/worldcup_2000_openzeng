-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Make sure java is installed and your $CLASSPATH contains the appropriate 
IBM JDK jar files (for some reason, tools.jar must be explicitly listed in 
order to get JPDA to work.)  Add jprobe2.zip from this package to the 
classpath, and invoke jdaemon with a port number:

  $ jdaemon 2525

  Optionally, you may append '-d' to obtain some potentially useful debug
statements if you're having problems.  (Note that non-root users typically
cannot open ports below 1024, so you must use a higher number, as shown
above.)

You may then connect to the daemon with ICAT.  Please see the host-side 
documentation for further information.
